# zarchive
The zarchive is for anything that is NOT being used or updated frequently. If it is, it should be outside of the zarchive. The file structure here mimics the root file structure on purpose to convey this idea. Once anything is not being used frequently (which could be immediately) it should be moved to the appropriate location here.

The 'z' prefix is intended to mean this is infrequently accessed.

Reminder: boxes here refer to old spheres.
