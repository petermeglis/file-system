# file-system
Personal file system structure and information

Clone the repo in `/Users/<your_user>`, rename the directory to `fs`, and delete the `.git` directory.

- archive/
  - for backups (online accounts, local computers, phones) or projects/areas/resources that are no longer active
- boxes/
  - spheres of activity maintained long term (health, finances, travel, hobbies, productivity, apartment, etc.)
  - Update 1/6/24: I haven't really used this much, but I'll keep it because it's flexible.
- docs/
  - documents, PDFs, records, notes, scans, whatever else
- media/
  - photos and videos
- projects/
  - git repositories, coding projects, etc.
- sync/
  - this is my Google Drive backup and sync folder
- tmp/
  - a holding place for anything temporary

Tips:
- only categorize into a folder when >= 4 things can be grouped
- document names are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD - Description.extension`, e.g. `2020-02-06 - Fitness Assessment Results.pdf`
