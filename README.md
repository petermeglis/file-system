# file-system
Personal file system structure and information

created: 5 May 2020

## Standards and Usage
Directory names within any root directory should generally follow the YYYY_name style to indicate when they originated.

Spheres or boxes that contain code should create a 'repo' directory in their respective directory to differentiate the repo from any related resources.

tmp directories can be made in other directories to indicate these files or directories need a home.

zachive is intended for resources that are not being used much anymore. This means anything in the top directories excluding zarchive should be for content and resources access fairly frequently (at user discretion).

Once a sphere has decided to go to the zarchive, the name should be changed to YYYY-YYYY_name to indicate the time of access.


## Content Decisions

### Spheres vs. Boxes
Spheres are for CURRENT projects. Spheres turn into boxes after they are not being used anymore and should be put in the zarchive. The term sphere should only ever be referenced from this top directory and to mean something that is currently being worked on. These "projects" should be named as boxes everywhere else.

 ### z directories
 The 'z' prefix is intended to convey that this directory is not frequently accessed.
